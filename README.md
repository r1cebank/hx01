A 8-bit CPU design

Recently I've been reading a lot about electroincs. I found building a 8-bit CPU from scratch will help me understand how modern CPU is designed.

__Note:__  I am a software developer by trade, but I always interested in electroincs. During college years, I have made multiple projects using Arduino, Netduino. I also coded a multi threaded os for Netduino. Building this 8 bit CPU is diffcult and I am basically follwing what's in the Digital Computer Electroincs by Malvino. If any of you reading this is electric engineer by trade and find anything to improve. Please let me know. Thank You
